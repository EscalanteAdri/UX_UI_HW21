        </header>
        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">The ISC site was in dire need for a revamp as it was confusing to navigate and understand content,and the side was not welcoming or attractive. We propose a new pirmary Nav to help reorganize the content in a more user friendly way. We also suggest adding more color and making the site more inviting. The proposed ideas will transform the user experience and allow them to find what they are looking for faster and spend less time on the site lost.</p>

            <h3>Phase 4 - Prototyping </h3>

        <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">Prototyping stage came with lots of back and forth with testing and prototyping. I also find more of a style path for the new site as I create the prototype</p>

            <h3 class="white">Phase 5: User Testing + Outcomes </h3>
        </header>

        <p class="white cuteParagraph inline-block">Usubility testing consisted of 8 users either doing A/B testing or general usubility testing. My findings helped me refine the final prototype</p>

            <b>“It’s good that they have translations” [for news article] User 2</b>
        </div>

        <p class="white cuteParagraph inline-block">The best and most notible suggestion given was about the colors in the Low-Fi prototype not fitting the site very well. Although orange is often a color associated with the Indigenous peoples of Canada, the underlying meaning is somewhat sad. The orange color is suitable for some of the topics on the site but not all, for consistency sake, I decided to use earth tones/graphic designs to honour Mother earth.</p>

            <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">In conclusion, it is the little things that increase user happiness and elevates user experience. Do not be afriad to go out side of the box. Emapthy is key. In the future I would love to get input from users who use the site very often to get a better understanding of how the content should be organized.</p>
        </div>
            <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">Another feature that could be added is more information on how to get in contact with a local office for more questions as there is only so much you can do on the site to improve information conprehension. Further I would love to see the news section moved to the top or used more frequestly to highligh great things in these communities as it helps users feel appreciated and seen.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="cuteParagraph inline-block">Tradzie, was designed to achieve a seamless and easy way to trade services and goods. We have observed that consumers feel traditional methods of buying and selling transactional, cold, expensive and unsustainable. This is creating buyers with less buying power, less options for items and services needed, sellers who feel less value for what they are offering, and all feeling less connected to their community. How might we change the structure of buying and selling so consumers and sellers are successful based on what they can offer to attain products and/or services without the use of money?</p>
